# Interview Preparation Prompt Templates

A collection of reusable prompts for generating and maintaining technical interview Q&A documents.

---

## PROMPT 1: GENERATE NEW CONTENT

Use this prompt to create interview Q&A from scratch for any topic.

---

As an AI assistant specializing in technical interview preparation, generate a comprehensive set of interview questions and answers for [TOPIC]. Follow these guidelines strictly:

1. **Question Generation**:
   - Create 50-100 unique questions (scale based on topic breadth), covering basic to advanced levels.
   - Include a mix of question types: conceptual/theoretical, practical/coding-related (if applicable), troubleshooting/debugging, scenario-based (real-world situations, e.g., "What would you do if..."), and system design where relevant.
   - Ensure questions are commonly asked in senior-level interviews for roles like full-stack engineer, with a focus on cross-team, event-driven, distributed, and microservices architectures where relevant.
   - Categorize questions by difficulty: Basic (foundational concepts), Intermediate (practical application), Advanced (complex scenarios, best practices, edge cases).
   - Number them sequentially (e.g., 1., 2., etc.) and include a brief category tag (e.g., [Basic], [Intermediate], [Advanced], [Scenario]).
   - Include follow-up questions interviewers commonly ask (e.g., "Can you explain the trade-offs?", "How would you scale this?").

2. **Answer Generation**:
   - After generating all questions, provide detailed answers for each one.
   - Structure each answer clearly: Start with a concise explanation, then provide examples (code snippets, diagrams, or step-by-step walkthroughs where applicable), and end with key takeaways or best practices.
   - Use real-world examples relevant to [TOPIC], such as code samples, configuration files, or hypothetical scenarios.
   - Keep answers comprehensive but concise—aim for 100-300 words per answer to cover depth without verbosity.
   - Highlight common pitfalls, anti-patterns, pros/cons, and how the topic relates to broader concepts like scalability, security, or performance.
   - Flag deprecated APIs, outdated patterns, or practices that are no longer recommended—explain the modern alternative.
   - Where applicable, include ASCII diagrams or suggest architecture visualizations.
   - Add brief "What interviewers look for" tips for key questions.

3. **Output Format**:
   - First, list all questions in a numbered list.
   - Then, provide answers in a matching numbered list.
   - If the total output exceeds reasonable limits (e.g., due to length), process in batches of 20-30 questions/answers at a time, clearly labeling each batch (e.g., "Batch 1: Questions 1-20 and Answers").
   - Do not ask for confirmation or approval before proceeding to the next batch—continue automatically until complete.
   - Group questions by logical sections/themes with clear headings.

4. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Ensure questions are original, non-repetitive, and directly relevant to [TOPIC].
   - Answers should be accurate, up-to-date (as of 2026), and include practical examples using current library versions and best practices.
   - If [TOPIC] involves code, use syntax-highlighted snippets in the appropriate language with modern syntax (e.g., Python 3.12+, TypeScript 5+, etc.).
   - Cross-reference related concepts when they enhance understanding.

Replace [TOPIC] with your desired subject (e.g., "Git, GitHub, CI/CD, and Jenkins") and provide this prompt to an AI tool for generation.

## PROMPT 2: UPDATE EXISTING CONTENT

Use this prompt when you have an existing interview prep document and want to refresh/update it. Copy-paste the prompt below along with your existing content.

---

As an AI assistant specializing in technical interview preparation, review and update the following existing interview Q&A document for [TOPIC]. Follow these guidelines strictly:

**EXISTING CONTENT:**
```
[PASTE YOUR EXISTING CONTENT HERE]
```

**Update Instructions:**

1. **Content Preservation**:
   - Do NOT delete any existing questions unless they are exact duplicates.
   - Preserve the existing file structure, formatting style, and numbering scheme.
   - Keep consolidated questions intact—do not split them back.

2. **Content Modernization**:
   - Update all code examples to use current best practices and latest stable versions (as of 2026).
   - Replace deprecated APIs, libraries, or patterns with modern alternatives (e.g., `aioredis` → `redis.asyncio`, `langchain.llms` → `langchain_openai`).
   - Update version numbers in Dockerfiles, package versions, and tool references.
   - Modernize syntax (e.g., `Optional[str]` → `str | None` for Python 3.10+).

3. **Duplicate Handling**:
   - Identify and merge duplicate questions—consolidate into the more comprehensive version.
   - If two questions cover the same concept differently, keep the better one and enhance it.

4. **Quality Improvements**:
   - Improve existing answers to be more accurate and aligned with current industry standards.
   - Add missing practical examples, code snippets, or diagrams where beneficial.
   - Fix any structural issues (misplaced questions, empty sections, broken links).
   - Ensure the Table of Contents (if present) matches actual section headings.

5. **New Content Addition**:
   - Add new industry-standard interview questions that are commonly asked but missing.
   - Include emerging topics relevant to [TOPIC] (e.g., for AI: MCP, RAGAS, prompt injection, semantic caching).
   - Ensure new questions follow the existing difficulty categorization and formatting.

6. **Output Format**:
   - Return the COMPLETE updated document, not just the changes.
   - Maintain the original markdown structure.
   - If output is too long, process in sections and label each (e.g., "Section 1 of 3").
   - Continue automatically without asking for confirmation.

7. **Change Summary**:
   - At the end, provide a brief summary of changes made:
     - Number of duplicates removed
     - Deprecated patterns updated
     - New questions added
     - Structural fixes applied

## PROMPT 3: QUICK REVIEW & VALIDATION

Use this prompt to validate an existing document is up to industry standards without making changes.

---

As an AI assistant, review the following interview preparation document for [TOPIC] and provide a quality assessment:

**CONTENT TO REVIEW:**
```
[PASTE YOUR CONTENT HERE]
```

**Review Checklist:**

1. **Accuracy Check**:
   - Are all code examples using current syntax and APIs?
   - Are version numbers and library references up-to-date (as of 2026)?
   - Are there any deprecated patterns or anti-patterns presented as best practices?

2. **Completeness Check**:
   - Are there any major topics missing for [TOPIC]?
   - Is there a good balance of Basic/Intermediate/Advanced questions?
   - Are common interview scenarios covered?

3. **Quality Check**:
   - Are answers comprehensive with practical examples?
   - Are there any duplicate or redundant questions?
   - Is the structure logical and easy to navigate?

4. **Output Format**:
   - Provide a score (1-10) for each category above.
   - List specific issues found with line references if possible.
   - Suggest improvements ranked by priority (High/Medium/Low).
   - Do NOT rewrite the content—just provide the assessment.
