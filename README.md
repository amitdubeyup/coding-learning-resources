## 🤖 Interview Content Update Prompt

Copy-paste the prompt below to update any interview guide file(s) in this repo:

> I'm sharing interview preparation file(s). Please review and improve them with the following instructions:
>
> 1. **Do not delete any existing questions.** If a question needs improvement, update the answer but keep the question.
>
> 2. **Identify and remove duplicate questions.** If the same question appears multiple times (even with slightly different wording), remove the duplicate and keep the better version.
>
> 3. **Improve existing answers** to be more accurate, current with industry standards, and include practical code examples where helpful. Replace any outdated content (deprecated APIs, old library versions, obsolete patterns) with modern equivalents.
>
> 4. **Add new industry-standard interview questions** that are commonly asked in real interviews but are missing. Ensure comprehensive topic coverage — think about what a senior engineer or interviewer at a top company would expect candidates to know on this subject.
>
> 5. **Update all code examples** to use current best practices and latest stable versions of libraries/frameworks.
>
> 6. **Keep the existing file structure and formatting style.** Match the heading levels, numbering, and code block conventions already used in the file(s).
